## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I am currently a Master's Data Science student at Columbia University.

As an aspiring data scientist and machine learning enthusiast, I am looking to use my problem-solving skills to drive insights and technology that have an impact on online platforms and user experience. I believe my collaboration skills gained from projects that were led under pressure and time constraints allow my team to consistently deliver.

I'm also passionate about other topics such as music composition, music production, and film-making. My creative background makes me a creative data enthusiast that differs from others by constantly thinking outside the box and looking for imaginative solutions.

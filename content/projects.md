## Projects

- [Squeeze-and-excitation Networks](https://github.com/anhvung/Squeeze-and-Excitation-Networks): TensorFlow implementation of Squeeze-and-excitation blocks on different convolutional neural networks such as ResNet-18, ResNeXt-29 and InceptionV3 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet. [[Report]](https://github.com/anhvung/Squeeze-and-Excitation-Networks/blob/main/E4040.2021Fall.FREN.report.an3078.av3023.wab2138.pdf).

- [Image classification using merged CNNs - Kaggle challenge](https://github.com/anhvung/Kaggle-bottle-classification): a use of two merged pre-trained convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50V2 and InceptionV3) to get a top score in a bottle classification Kaggle challenge. The model predicts how much water or soda a bottle contains.

- [Analysis of pro-level competitive matches in Counter-Strike Global Offensive](https://github.com/anhvung/csgo_pro_matches_analysis): a data visualization and exploration of matches in a first person shooter game using R and D3.

- [Graph animation guide with gg animate and After Effects](https://github.com/anhvung/EDAV-CC): a guide on graph animations with a workflow involving gganimate and Adobe After Effects. 

- [Linear time densest subgraph approximation](https://github.com/anhvung/Densest-Subgraph-Algorithm): analysis of very large graphs requires approximation algorithms to efficiently retrieve information. A linear time of a 2-approximation algorithm was implemented in Python and C++ [[Report]](https://github.com/anhvung/Densest-Subgraph-Algorithm/blob/main/REPORT.pdf).

- [Decentralized Task-distribution in Peer-to-Peer Networks](https://github.com/anhvung/DecentralizedP2PTaskDistribution): Netlogo implementation of a multi-agent system that achieves decentralized task-distribution in peer-to-peer networks. A set of agents aim to distribute a number of tasks of different types equally among themselves by coordination via a communication network. [[Report (French)]](https://github.com/anhvung/DecentralizedP2PTaskDistribution/blob/master/Rapport-PAF.pdf)

- [3D Maze using the Java 3D api](https://github.com/anhvung/3DMaze): a 3D maze using Java3D with a dynamic camera, adaptive mini-map and auto solver functionality.

- [Green Guy Project](https://github.com/anhvung/GreenGuyProject): innovation project - online platform that allows users to promote ecology through geo-located events. (Team of 7 students working on a community-based project)

- [Forum shooter Android version - Android port of an Unreal engine 4 first person shooter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.YourCompany.ForumShooterAndroid): a solo game project made to promote a career fair event organized by students at Telecom Paris. Changes had to be made to port the game to Android.

- [Forum shooter - Unreal engine 4 first person shooter](https://anh-vu.itch.io/forumshooter): a solo UE4 game project made to promote a career fair event organized by students at Telecom Paris.
